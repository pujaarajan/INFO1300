_____ (10) Web Page Subtask

    _____ (4) PHP

        _____ (2) Each page uses a valid include statement

        _____ (1) Included files are in the "includes" directory

        _____ (1) PHP does not output errors or warnings
    
    _____ (6) HTML and CSS

        _____ (1) Two different pages with the same fixed header

        _____ (2) All fixed headers are generated with PHP includes

        _____ (1) HTML files named correctly, in correct directory

        _____ (2) Entire page (after including headers) validates

_____ (25) PHP Language Subtask

    _____ (15) Array Iteration

        _____ (1) All entries of each loop are on their own line

        _____ (1) Each loop begins with "Loop #" and loop sections are separated by three new lines

        _____ (1) Code does not output any errors or warnings

        _____ (3) Loop 1

            _____ (1) Code uses for-loop (and not a foreach-loop)

            _____ (1) Printed array values begin with "i: "

            _____ (1) Output contains all values of $plain_array

        _____ (3) Loop 2

            _____ (1) Code uses foreach-loop (and not a for-loop)

            _____ (1) Printed array values begin with "value: "

            _____ (1) Output contains all values of $plain_array

        _____ (3) Loop 3

            _____ (1) Code uses loop (for or foreach)

            _____ (1) Printed array values begin with "value: "

            _____ (1) Output contains only the integers of $plain_array; integer checking is robust to differences in input (e.g., code cannot just check if the value is equal to "four")

        _____ (3) Loop 4

                _____ (1) Code uses foreach loop

                _____ (1) Printed array entries contain the key of the array and the value of the array, separated by a colon

                _____ (1) Output contains all values of $assoc_array

    _____ (10) Random Numbers

        _____ (1) Code does not output any errors or warnings

        _____ (4) make_randoms function

            _____ (1) Contains code that correctly generates single random integers between 1 and 5 (inclusive)

            _____ (1) Contains code that correctly appends values to an array

            _____ (1) Adds numbers to the array and prints out the contents of the array using two different for loops

            _____ (1) Returns an array with 10 randomly generated integers between 1 and 5

        _____ (4) get_and_sort function

            _____ (1) Calls make_randoms function

            _____ (1) Uses a loop to iterate over output array of make_randoms function

            _____ (1) Prints all entries of the output array that are greater than 3

            _____ (1) Returns the array generated by make_randoms

        _____ (1) Code calls the get_and_sort function

_____ (35) Total
